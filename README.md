## Commission Logic & Architecture
- **Commission rules** _(deposit and withdraw, private vs. business)_ are implemented as separate classes under `Service/Commission/Rules`
- **Weekly free allowance** for private withdrawals is tracked in memory by `WithdrawalTrackerService`
- **Currency conversion** uses a resilient HTTP client _(AbstractHttpService)_ with retry/backoff
- **Precision math** is handled via a thin `Support/Math` wrapper around BC Math functions

## Libraries & Tools
- **PHP dotenv**: Loads environment variables from `.env` files
- **PHP BC Math**: Handles precise calculations
- **Guzzle**: PHP HTTP client with exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Mockery**: Mock object framework for testing
- **PHPUnit**: Unit testing framework
- **PHP CS Fixer**: Ensures code formatting and standards
