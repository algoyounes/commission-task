## Commission Logic
- **Commission rules** _(deposit and withdraw, private vs business)_ are implemented as separate classes under `Services/Commission/Rules`
- **Weekly free allowance** for private withdrawals is tracked in memory by `WithdrawalTrackerService`
- **Currency conversion** uses a resilient HTTP client `AbstractHttpService` with `retry/backoff`
- **Precision math** is handled via a thin `Support/Math` wrapper around BC Math for accurate decimal operations

## Libraries
- **[PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)** : Loads environment variables from `.env` files
- **[PHP BC Math](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php)** : Handles precise calculations for floating-point math
- **[Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle)** : PHP HTTP client with exponential backoff for failed requests
- **[Mockery](https://github.com/mockery/mockery)** : Mocking dependencies to keep tests isolated
- **[PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit)** : Writing and executing unit tests
- **[PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer)** : Ensures code formatting and standards
